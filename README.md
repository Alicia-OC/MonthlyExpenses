# Peekly 💸

Your **favorite minimalist and cute app** to track expenses and manage your budget effortlessly.  
Whether you’re the “quick add” type who just wants to jot down that coffee, or a detail enthusiast who loves logging every penny (and the exact time you bought it 😎), Peekly has you covered… well, almost — **details on the items are still a WIP xP**.

## 🔐 User Accounts & MongoDB

Peekly isn’t just a front-end toy — it’s a **full-stack app with MongoDB**!

- Users can **create accounts** and securely store their expense cards.
- **Custom costs** can be pre-set and automatically added to new cards.
- Users can **add their own avatar** or... that's the idea. For now, everyone will have a cute Anya avatar!

## 📆 Cards & Library

- Currently, users can create **one card per month**, but no worries — Peekly will **auto-create it** on your first login of the month.  
- Within each card, you can **add or remove as many items as you want**. The only limit is your real budget… or not! 😅  
- If you want to end the month with **negative savings**, Peekly won’t stop you (although we don’t exactly recommend it 😉).

- All cards are neatly organized in a **library**, and soon you’ll be able to **edit old cards** (for those chocolate bars you forgot to log last Friday 😉).
